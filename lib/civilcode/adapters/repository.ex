defmodule CivilCode.Repository do
  @moduledoc """
  A Repository hydrates and persists an Aggregate.

  ## Usage

  CivilCode implements persistence-oriented, save-based Repository (12). This is because Ecto
  doesnâ€™t implicitly or explicitly detect and track data changes, which is not unexpected in a
  functional programming environment. A Repository should mimic a collection as much as possible,
  even though this repository is not a collection-based repository, i.e. it appears the collection
  is in-memory.

  A Repository hydrates an aggregate and persists the aggregate using the `save/1` function. See
  `CivilCode.Repository.Behaviour`.

  The Repository is the perfect place to handle unique constraint errors and other issues related
  to collections and persistence.

  Repositories can be adapters for other stores beyond a traditional RDBMS. These may be a key-value
  store or even the file system.

  For more complex queries required for a use case:

  > You might instead use what is called a use case optimal query. This is where you specify a
    complex query against the persistence mechanism, dynamically placing the results into a
    Value Object (6) specifically designed to address the needs of the use case. [IDDD, p. 517]

  Repositories MAYBE BE used for __Rich-Domain__ Architectures.

  Both of these architectures require Commands which cast Params to Value Objects, it is the
  invalid Command in the form of a `Ecto.Changeset.t()` that is returned to the client. Although,
  Entity domain actions return `Ecto.Changeset.t()` in a Rich-Domain Architecture they are not returned
  to the client as the data is already validated, therefore an explicit `CivilCode.RepositoryError.t()` must
  be returned.

  ## From the Experts

  > This basic set of principles applies to a DDD Repository. Placing an Aggregate (10) instance in
  > its corresponding Repository, and later using that Repository to retrieve the same instance,
  > yields the expected whole object. If you alter a preexisting Aggregate instance that you
  > retrieve from the Repository, its changes will be persisted. If you remove the instance from
  > the Repository, you will be unable to retrieve it from that point forward. [IDDD, p. 401]
