  CivilCode implements persistence-oriented, save-based Repository (12). This is because Ecto
  doesnâ€™t implicitly or explicitly detect and track data changes, which is not unexpected in a
  functional programming environment. A Repository should mimic a collection as much as possible,
  even though this repository is not a collection-based repository, i.e. it appears the collection
  is in-memory.

  A Repository hydrates an aggregate and persists the aggregate using the `save/1` function.

  The Repository is the perfect place to handle unique constraint errors and other issues related
  to collections and persistence.

  Repositories can be adapters for other stores beyond a traditional RDBMS. These may be a key-value
  store or event the file system.
