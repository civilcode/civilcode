  Based on the text from Vernon, a Command is considered an application concern. We acknowleged
  that others have different opinions:

  > Commands belong to the core domain (just like domain events). They play an important role in the
    CQRS architecture â€“ they explicitly represent what the clients can do with the application. Just
    like events represent what the outcome of those actions could be.
